                            in July of 2019 from one of our adoption events <br>
                            when he was just 2 months old. He was <br>
                            only 2 weeks old when we rescued him along with <br>
                            his two siblings and his mother. Now, he lives  <br>
                            Los Angeles where he spends his day catnapping in <br>
                            the sun and stepping on computers.

                            Cheeto came to us after his owner got a new <br>
                            job and lo longer had enough time to spend with <br>
                            him. He was adopted by a young newly wed couple <br>
                            and absolutely loves going to the dog park and <br>
                            swimming in the pool but will always take a <br>
                            break to enjoy some peanut butter and belly rubs. <br>
                            He especially loves walking around downtown <br>
                            and getting the attention of people on the street. <br>

                            Buttercup was adopted by a family in August <br>
                            of 2020. We rescued his pregnant mother off <br>
                            the streets and she gave birth in our care.  <br>
                            We are happy to say that all five of her kittens <br>
                            are healthy and happy and have also found forever <br>
                            homes. Buttercup is now four months old and has <br>
                            adjusted well to her new home. She is very much an <br>
                            active kitten, spending all day playing with the kids <br>
                            or tormenting her new kitty brother. <br>
